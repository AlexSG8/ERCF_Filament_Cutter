 <img src="EREC_MODS.png" width=100% >  

Welcome to the Usermods section of EREC, where you can find useful mods for the cutter. <br>
<strong>Note: I'm not responsible for the mods! This also means I am not responsible for keeping the mods updated, if something doesn't work, don't blame me. I will try my best to keep any mods compatible with the next versions of EREC. </strong>
## Rules

All mods should follow the [mod submission rules](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/wiki/Mod-Submission-Rules) from the VORON Design team, the folder structure should be similar to EREC: 

    â””â”€â”€ Usermods/
        â””â”€â”€YourUsername/
            â”œâ”€â”€ ModName/
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ STL/
            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [a]_accent_part.stl
            â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ non_accent_part.stl
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CAD/
            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ step_file.step
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Images/
            â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Doc/
            â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
            â””â”€â”€ ModName2/
                ....

You don't have to be fancy with the Readme, add a little description, BOM, some images and if needed some assembly instructions. You can find a template [here]().
